# Space Missions Analysis and Web Scrapping
This project was created in 2 steps:
The first step was to scrape a dataset from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/past/?page=1). The output includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Missions in 1957!

The second step was a data analysis from the dataset scraped.
